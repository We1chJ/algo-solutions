# Problem: [2864. Maximum Odd Binary Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-odd-binary-number/description/)

# Difficulty: <span style = "color:green">Easy</span>

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
The key observation is that in base 2, all the bits is a power of 2, `2^n`, which means that numbers represented by these bits are all even numbers. The sum of these even numbers are surely even as well. However, the 1st bit is the exception because it is `2^0`, which is 1 (odd!). No matter what other bits are, as long as a number has the 1st bit as 1, it is an odd number. 

So the solution would be to simply count the number of 1s in the string, and put all 1s in the beginning of the string to maximize the number but save the last 1 on the first bit to make it an odd number.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(N)$$
- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(1)$$

Note: I kept the original string s variable and just clean and update on it to save up space.

# Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string maximumOddBinaryNumber(string s) {
        int cnt1 = 0;
        for(int i  = 0; i < s.length();i++){
            if(s[i] == '1'){ 
                cnt1++;
                s[i] = '0';
            }
        }
        int ind = 0;
        while(cnt1 > 1){
            s[ind++] = '1';
            cnt1--;
        }

        s[s.length()-1] = '1';
        return s;       

    }
};
```
