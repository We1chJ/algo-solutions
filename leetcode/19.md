# Problem: [19. Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/description/)

# Difficulty: <span style = "color:orange">Medium</span>

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
It is easy to do this without the extra challenge of solving this in one pass: one intuitive way is to run the list once and the whole length of the list, then find the `nth` node in forward order, traverse through the list again and remove the node.

Although my first solution implementing this beat 100% for some reasons, I found the second solution smart by doing everything in one pass...

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
The key question is how do we locate the `nth` node backward when traversing forward? We don't know where is the end and thus cannot do any tracking of the indices by counting in forward direction.

The trick is to use two pointers: one being the slow one, the other being the fast pointer. The fast pointer will be `n` nodes ahead of the slow pointer before having both of them moving forward syncrhonously. When the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, we then inherently know that, at that moment, we are at the end and the node that slow pointer is pointing at has to be the `nth` node backward. Thus removing the node.

Be careful to handle the special cases of removing the very first and last node in the list.

        ListNode* slow = head;

        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            fast = fast->next;
        }
        if(fast == NULL){
            return slow->next;
        }

        while(fast->next!=NULL){
            fast = fast ->next;
            slow = slow ->next;
        }
        if(slow->next == NULL){
            slow ->next = NULL;
