# Problem: [1750. Minimum Length of String After Deleting Similar Ends](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-length-of-string-after-deleting-similar-ends/description/)

# Difficulty: <span style="color:orange">Medium</span>

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
The actions are straightforward and look like just a simulation problem.

So our job is to simulate this **cleverly**.

Since we are dealing with prefixes and suffixes with same characters only, we can put two pointers on each end of the string, moving towards the center as long as both pointers are pointing at same characters every loop.

Note: This problem has a few edge cases where the last remaining string consists of only one character (e.g. `aaaaa`). 
- Case 1: If this remaining string's length is greater than 1, we can just remove them all as usual by pushing the pointers. 
- Case 2: However, if the length is only 1 (e.g. `a`), according to rule 3:
> The prefix and the suffix should not intersect at any index.
the remaining string `a` cannot be removed. 

To handle these, in my solution below, notice that in the second inner while loop, the condition is `l <= r` instead of `l < r` so that if in Case 1, pointer `r` will proceed even reaches `l` and become 1 index to the left of `l`, resulting in final answer `r - l + 1` to be 0. If in Case 2, `l` and `r` will stop at the same index and resulting in a remaining length of 1.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(N)$$
- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(1)$$
# Code
``` cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumLength(string s) {
        int l =0, r = s.length()-1;
        while(l < r && s[l] == s[r]){
            char c = s[l];
            while(l < r && s[l] == c)
                l++;
            
            while(l <= r && s[r] == c)
                r--;
        }
        return r - l +  1;
    }
};
```
