# Problem: [349. Intersection of Two Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays/description/)

# Difficulty: <span style = "color:green">Easy</span>

# Approach
There are multiple ways to solve this problem:

1. Keep a hashset of one of the array and then while looping through the other array, check if the element is also contained in the hashset
2. Sort both arrays. Put one pointer on each array (total two pointers). Traversing through both and check if current elements are the same
3. Sort both arrays. Perform binary search to see if an element is contained in the other array.

# Complexity
Time Complexity:

- Hashset → $O(N)$
- Two Pointers → $O(NlogN)$
- Binary Search → $O(NlogN)$

Space Complexity:
$O(N)$ for all

# Code
Only the solution for Hashset solution is shown:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> intersection(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        unordered_set<int> s1(nums1.begin(), nums1.end());
        
        vector<int> sol;

        for(auto a : nums2){
            if(s1.contains(a)){
                sol.push_back(a);
                s1.erase(a);
            }
        }
        return sol;
    }
};
```
