# Problem: [3005. Count Elements With Maximum Frequency](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-elements-with-maximum-frequency/description/)

# Difficulty: <span style = "color:green">Easy</span>

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
Use a HashMap to store the frequencies of the numbers. Then loop over the frequency map to count the numbers of number with the maximum frequency. The answer will be the `count*frequency`, because all numbers considered have the same max frequency. 

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(N)$$
- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(N)$$
# Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxFrequencyElements(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_map<int, int> map;
        for(auto a : nums){
            map[a]++;
        }
        int m = 0;
        int cnt = 0;
        for(auto a : map){
            if(a.second > m){
                m = a.second;
                cnt = 1;
            }else if(a.second == m)
                cnt++;
        }
        return cnt * m;
    }
