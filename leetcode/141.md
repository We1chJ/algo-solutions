# Problem: [141. Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/description/)

# Difficulty: <span style = "color:green">Easy</span>

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
- **Soluiton 1**: Create a hashset on visited nodes and constantly check if a node is already visited.
- **Solution 2**: *Floyd's Cylce Detection:* Use Two pointers, a fast one and a slow one to run on the list. The fast pointer will move by 2 every turn whereas the slow pointer only moves by 1. If there exists a cycle, the fast pointer will definitely at some point (after catching up the length of the cycle) to meet the slow pointer on the same node.
- **Solution 3**: This is a solution with $$O(1)$$ Constant Space Complexity. Since the problem description stated that the whole length of the linkedlist does not exceed `10^4`, we can simply traverse over to the next node `10^4` times. If it reaches an end in the middle, there is no cycle. Otherwise a cycle exists.

# Code
# Solution 1 (Normal)
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(N)$$

- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(N)$$
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {
        unordered_set<ListNode *> s;
        while(head != NULL){
            if(s.contains(head)) return true;
            s.insert(head);
            head = head->next;
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```
# Solution 2 ([Floyd's Cycle Detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_detection#Floyd's_tortoise_and_hare))
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(\mu+\lambda)$$ where $$\mu$$ is the index where the cycle starts, and $$\lambda$$ is the length of the cycle

- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(1)$$
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {
        ListNode * fast = head;
        ListNode * slow = head;
        do{
            if(fast == NULL) return false;
            fast = fast ->next;
            if(fast == NULL) return false;
            fast = fast -> next;
            slow = slow ->next;
        }while(fast != slow);
        return true;
    }
};
```
# Solution 3 (Cheat)
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(10^4)$$

- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(1)$$
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {
        for(int i = 0; i <= 1e4; i++){
            if(head == NULL) return false;
            head = head->next;
        }
        return true;        
    }
};
```
