The problem description is straightforward. The intuitive approach is to run a Breadth First Search on the tree in a queue so the conditions can be checked on each level.

What is noteworthy is that there is a nice and clean way to perform tree traversal by levels (see solution below) by using two nested while loops: outer one handling the whole tree, and the inner one only processing nodes on one level. The core idea is that every time the inner while loop starts, the whole queue contains only nodes on the same level at that moment. 


# Solution
Time Complexity: $O(N)$

Space Complexity: $O(N)$

``` cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };

public:
    bool isEvenOddTree(TreeNode* root) {
        queue<TreeNode*> q;
        q.push(root);
        int depth = 0;
        while(q.size()){
            int size = q.size();
            int prev = (depth%2 == 0 ? 0 : INT_MAX);
            while(size--){
                auto node = q.front();
                q.pop();

                if(depth%2 == 0){
                    if(node->val %2 == 0 || node->val <= prev) return false;
                }else{
                    if(node->val%2 == 1 || node->val >= prev) return false;
                }
                prev = node->val;
                if(node->left) q.push(node->left);
                if(node->right) q.push(node->right);
            }
            depth++;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
