# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
This problem turns out to be solvable with just greedy. 

Our goal is to maximize the score. Everytime we face-up/face-down, the gain/loss of score is a constant 1, which means we should always face-up tokens with lowest power loss to get 1 score, and always face-down tokens with highest power gain to sacrifice 1 score. 

Following this idea, we can develop this greedy approach, where we first sort the tokens in ascending order, and have two pointers each starting on either end of the list. The left pointer tries to trade power for scores as much as possible, whereas the right pointer re-supplies the power by trading score for power, until both pointer meets or one reaches to the end.


# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(NlogN)$$ 

- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(1)$$ 

# Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int bagOfTokensScore(vector<int>& tokens, int power) {
        sort(tokens.begin(), tokens.end());
        int n = tokens.size();
        int l = 0, r = n-1;
        int score = 0;
        int ans = 0;
        while(l <= r){
            while(l <= r && l < n && power >= tokens[l]){
                power -= tokens[l++];
                score ++;
                ans = max(ans, score);
            }
            while(l <= r && l < n && power < tokens[l] && score > 0){
                power += tokens[r--];
                score--;
                ans = max(ans, score);
            }
            if(l >= n || (power < tokens[l] && score == 0)) break;
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
