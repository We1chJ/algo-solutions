# Problem: [2446. Determine if Two Events Have Conflict](https://leetcode.com/problems/determine-if-two-events-have-conflict/description/)

# Difficulty: <span style = "color:green">Easy</span>

# Approach

<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
Since we know that `start_time` < `end_time` for any events, this problem can be intuitively solved with the logic:

Two events **do not** have conflicts as long as one event ends earlier than the second event starts, which is `end1` < `start2`.

Remember to check for both cases of event1 happening first or event2 happening first

# Complexity

- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(1)$$
- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(1)$$

# Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // true if time1 is earlier than time2, false otherwise
    bool compare(int h1, int m1, int h2, int m2){
        return h1 < h2 || (h1 == h2 && m1 < m2);
    }
    bool haveConflict(vector<string>& event1, vector<string>& event2) {
        int start1H = stoi(event1[0].substr(0, 2)), start1M = stoi(event1[0].substr(3, 2));
        int end1H = stoi(event1[1].substr(0, 2)), end1M = stoi(event1[1].substr(3, 2));
        int start2H = stoi(event2[0].substr(0, 2)), start2M = stoi(event2[0].substr(3, 2));
        int end2H = stoi(event2[1].substr(0, 2)), end2M = stoi(event2[1].substr(3, 2));
        return !(compare(end1H, end1M, start2H, start2M) || compare(end2H, end2M, start1H, start1M));
    }
}
