# Problem: [2485. Find the Pivot Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-pivot-integer/description/)

# Difficulty: <span style = "color:orange">Medium</span>

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
We can solve this problem easily by going to over each number as `x` betweewn 1 and n in order, and check if the sum of each side satisfies the conditions by maintaining a sum for each side.

We can do this in two passes, where the first pass is used to calculate the sum of the whole array. However, it can also be calculated in constant time using arithmetic sum formula $$Sum = n*(1+n)/2$$

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(N)$$
- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(1)$$
# Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int pivotInteger(int n) {
        int s1=0, s2=(n*(n+1))/2;
        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
            s1 += i;
            // Note that the both sums includes x, the pivot point
            if((s2-s1 + i) == s1)
                return i;
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```
