57. Insert Interval

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
The problem itself is straightforward--It boils down to a simulation problem of merging intervals.

The noteworthy part is how do we implement the solution cleanly? 

Essentially we can break the whole merging process into 3 parts:
1. Before any interval overlaps, simply add them
2. Once `newIntervals` starts to overlap with other intervals, merge all of the overlapping intervals
3. After merging, simply add all of those at the end that don't overlap

We enter stage 2 once we detect the first overlapping intervals during stage 1.

There are 3 main ways `newInterval` can overlap with the intervals:
1. `newInterval` completely being wrapped inside, which would have no effects on the array. No need to perform any actions. 
`a__ni______nj__b` 
2. The end of an interval is in `newInterval`:
`a__ni_____b___nj`
3. The start of an interval is in `newInterval`
`ni__a___nj____b`

`where ni, nj is the start, end of newInterval. a, b are those of an original interval`

Note that each happens consecutively within each category. Therefore, we run three while loops to handle each.

$$O(N)$$

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> insert(vector<vector<int>>& intervals, vector<int>& newInterval) {
        vector<vector<int>> ans ;
        int i= 0;
        int n = intervals.size();
        while(i < n && intervals[i][1] < newInterval[0]){
            ans.push_back(intervals[i]);
            i++;
        }

        int st = newInterval[0], en = newInterval[1];
        while(i < n && intervals[i][0] <= en){
            st = min(st, intervals[i][0]);
            en = max(en, intervals[i][1]);
            i++;
        }
        ans.push_back({st, en});

        while(i < n){
            ans.push_back(intervals[i]);
            i++;
        } 

        return ans;       
    }
