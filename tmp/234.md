234. Palindrome Linked List

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
We essentially can reverse the second half of the node list and then compare the values by traversing the nodes from the two ends. The trick here is we can use Floyd's Cycle Detection technique with two pointers to find the middle point on the list efficiently in one pass.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(N)$$
- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(1)$$
# Code
```
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPalindrome(ListNode* head) {
        // Floyd's Cycle Detection to find the middle point
        ListNode * fast = head, *slow = head;
        while(fast != NULL && fast->next!= NULL){
            fast = fast->next->next;
            slow = slow->next;
        }

        // start reverse the 2nd half of the list 
        ListNode *prev = NULL, *cur = slow;
        while(cur != NULL){
            slow = cur->next;
            cur->next = prev;
            prev = cur;
            cur = slow;
        }

        // go over the list from two ends and compare the values
        ListNode *end = prev;
        while(head != NULL && end != NULL){
            if(head->val != end->val)
                return false;
            head = head->next;
            end = end->next;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
