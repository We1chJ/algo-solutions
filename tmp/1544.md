1544. Make The String Great

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
Although there are multiple ways to implement the searching and removing, using a stack for this problem is the most brilliant solution. 

Stack gives all the information needed because we are only caring about the adjacent letters, as well as giving us the next latest letter that hasn't been removed yet.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(N)$$
- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(N)$$
# Code
```
class Solution {
public:
    string makeGood(string s) {
        stack<char> v;
        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++){
            if(v.empty()){
                v.push(s[i]);
                continue;
            }
            if(v.top() == (char)tolower(s[i]) && isupper(s[i]))
                v.pop();
            else if(v.top() == (char) toupper(s[i]) && islower(s[i]))
                v.pop();
            else 
                v.push(s[i]);
        }
        string ans = "";
        while(v.size()){
            char a = v.top(); v.pop();
            ans = a + ans;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
