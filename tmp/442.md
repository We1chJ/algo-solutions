442. Find All Duplicates in an Array

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
1. Use a HashSet to keep track of numbers we've seen. Add to the answer vector if so.
2. Wormhole: We essentially use the numbers in the array as indices to go to for the next one. Due to the property that both every number and every index in the array is unique, the in-degree for each non-repeating number should be exactly 1. Therefore, if we treat the value of an element as the destination of an edge, we mark every destination point by negating their value. In the future, if we visit a destination that is already marked negative (visited), we conclude that our current element value is a repeating number (because in-degree is more than 1 now).

# Code 1 HashSet
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(N)$$
- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(1)$$
```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_set<int> set;
        vector<int> ans;
        for(auto a : nums){
            if(set.contains(a))
                ans.push_back(a);
            else
                set.insert(a);
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```
