2958. Length of Longest Subarray With at Most K Frequency

The daily problems are arranged in this way purposedfully... It helps me get the hang of similar problem-solving skills so effectively.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
When we are doing this type of subarray problems, we can always use slide windows to maintain the conditions in the range while finding the optimal window(subarray). Since frequency, just like sum or product in other similar problems, has **monotonous** properties when adding/removing an element from the window. We can use two pointers as the two sides of the windows. By fixing the right endpoint and shrinking the left end when necessary, we can efficiently find the optimal subarrays. 

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(N)$$
- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(1)$$
# Code
```
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSubarrayLength(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int ans =0;
        unordered_map<int, int> freq;
        for(int l = 0, r = 0; r < nums.size(); r++){
            freq[nums[r]]++;
            for(; l < r && freq[nums[r]] > k; l++){
                freq[nums[l]]--;
            }
            ans = max(ans, r - l + 1);
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
