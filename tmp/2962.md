2962. Count Subarrays Where Max Element Appears at Least K Times

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
P.s.: I first thought that the problem wants the maximum element in every subarray to have a frequency greater than `k`, which would've been an interesting quetsion. But note that it only cares about the frequency of the maximum element of the whole `num` array.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
This is another sliding window problem that resembles the two properties:
1. The property/condition to maintain in the subarray is easy to find/update (frequency of a known number is easy to update)
2. This property changes monotonously in each direction of expanding/shrinking the window.

I did not initially solve it using the traditional nested for-loops with two pointers. Although similar, I marked the indices where the max number occurs in the array first. And then shift window by move to the next index directly.

        for(int i = 0 ; i < nums.size(); i++){
            if(nums[i] > maxNum){
                ind.clear();
                maxNum = nums[i];
            }
            if(nums[i] == maxNum){
                ind.push_back(i);
            }
        }
        int n = ind.size();
        for(int i = 0; i < n - k + 1; i++){
            long long l = ind[i]+1, r = 1;
            if(i + k < n){
                r = ind[i+k] - ind[i+k-1];
            }else{
                r = nums.size() - ind[i+k-1];
            }
            ans += l*r;
        }

        return ans;
    }
