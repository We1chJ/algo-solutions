2444. Count Subarrays With Fixed Bounds

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
We use a slightly different sliding window techniques. Notice that if we can still use a two pointer technique to go over all subarrays, the condition does not get satisfied monotonously (min/max number can each change if we add/remove one element from the window). 

However, we can still check "all" subarrays by running a for-loop and fixing the right end as `i`. The key here is that we can efficiently check how many subarrays **ending at `i`** we can have by finding the distance between `min(mini, maxi)` and `badi`. `mini` stores the latest index at which `minK` occurs. Similarly does `maxi` store that at which `maxK` occurs. `badi` stores the latest index where a number outside the range `[minK, maxK]` occurs. So we can find the number of subarrays that contain `minK` and `maxK` without numbers outside the range by `max(0, min(mini, maxi) - badi)`. 

Summing up counts at all `i` will give us the number of all possible subarrays.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(N)$$
- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(1)$$
# Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long countSubarrays(vector<int>& nums, int minK, int maxK) {
        long long ans = 0;
        int mini = -1, maxi = -1, badi = -1;
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++){
            if(nums[i] == minK) mini = i;
            if(nums[i] == maxK) maxi = i;
            if(nums[i] < minK || nums[i] > maxK) badi = i;

            ans += max(0, min(mini, maxi) - badi);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
