143. Reorder List

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
Very similar technique from the daily problem yesterday: [234. Palindrome Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-linked-list/description/)

We notice that if we need to be able to access the nodes in the list from both the beginning and back easily. Therefore, we can reverse the linkedlist in the second half and then reorder the list by connecting the start and end of the list in a while loop.

To find the middle point for reversing the second half of the list, we use Floyd's Cycle Detection.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(N)$$
- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(1)$$
# Code
```

class Solution {
public:
    void reorderList(ListNode* head) {
        // find middle point, Floyd's Cycle Detection
        ListNode *fast = head, *slow = head;
        while(fast->next && fast->next->next){
            fast = fast ->next ->next;
            slow = slow->next;
        }
        // reverse the second half
        ListNode *prev = NULL, *cur = slow;
        while(cur){
            slow = cur->next;
            cur->next = prev;
            prev =cur;
            cur = slow;
        }
        // reorder the list
        ListNode *temp;
        while(head){
            temp = head->next;
            head->next = prev;
            head = prev;
            prev = temp;
        }
    }
