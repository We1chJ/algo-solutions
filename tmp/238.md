238. Product of Array Except Self

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
Remember, **no division, and O(1) extra space**.

Therefore, the idea of creating a separate prefix "product" array would not work, both because that would require extra space and division to find product of a range. 

However, it is not even necessary in this case. If we think a little more, knowing that we can't do division directly implies that we can **only** do multiplications. Each `answer[i]` is a product of prefix and suffix at element `i` (excluding `i`). Since the prefix/suffix at each element can be found easily if we traverse over `nums` in one direction, we can break the task into two parts in two passes:
- 1st pass: multiply in the **prefixes** of each `answer[i]` **from left to right**
- 2nd pass: multiply in the **suffixes** of each `answer[i]` **from right to left**

No division is used, and since the prefixes and suffixes do not interfere with each other, we can do this just on the `answer` array.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(N)$$
- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(1)$$ Extra space
# Code
```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> productExceptSelf(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> ans (n, 1);
        int pre = 1;
        // multiply all prefixes of each answer[i]
        for(int i = 0; i < n-1; i++){
            pre *= nums[i];
            ans[i+1] *= pre;
        }
        pre = 1;
        // then multiply all suffixes
        for(int i = n-1; i >= 1; i--){
            pre *= nums[i];
            ans[i-1] *= pre;
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
