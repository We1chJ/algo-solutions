713. Subarray Product Less Than K

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
We can use the idea of sliding windows with two pointers to efficiently count all possible subarrays.

I did it originally by fixing the left endpoint of the window and count subarrays with product `greater than and equal to k` and subtract it from total possible subarrays. A solution of fixing the right endpoint and computes the answer directly is also provided.

The reason that this efficient solution works is that, we know that the product can only increase (or stay the same) if we add one more element into the window, and only decrease if we remove one from the window. Thus by fixing one end of the window, we can reuse the product from before and just find the largest subarray `smaller than k`. Every subarrays within that subarrays are guaranteed smaller than `k`. This number of subarrays can be computed easily: `r - l + 1`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(N)$$
- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(1)$$

# Code (Fixed at the left endpoint)
```
class Solution {
public:
    int numSubarrayProductLessThanK(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        if(k <= 1) return 0;
        int ans = 0;
        int n = nums.size();
        int prod = 1;
        for(int l = 0, r = 0; l < n; prod /= nums[l], l++){
            r = max(r, l);
            while((r < n && prod < k)){
                prod *= nums[r];
                r++;
            }
            if(prod >= k)
                ans += n - r + 1;
        }
        cout << ans;
        return n*(n+1)/2 - ans;
    }
};
```

# Code (Fixed at the right endpoint)
```
class Solution {
public:
    int numSubarrayProductLessThanK(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        if(k == 0 || k == 1) return 0;
        int n = nums.size();
        int l = 0, r = 0;
        int prod = 1;
        int ans = 0;
        for(; r < n; r++){
            prod *= nums[r];
            for(; l <= r && prod >= k; l++){
                prod /= nums[l];
            }
            ans += r - l + 1;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
