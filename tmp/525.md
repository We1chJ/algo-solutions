525. Contiguous Array

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
This problem employs a common combination of Prefix Sum and HashTable that is used in a lot of similar problems regarding subarrays (potentially Sliding Window).

Essentially, the binary nature of all numbers in this array (`0` and `1`) allows us to tell how many numbers of `1` or `0` have appeared in a range from the range sum. However, `0` is a number that even if added to a sum, we wouldn't be able to tell if we have one more `0` or not. Therefore we treat `0` as `-1` here instead so that when we have a sum, we would be able to tell the relative quantity of `0` and `1`. 

Using prefix sum, we can confirm that a subarray from `i` to `j` has the same number of `0` and `1` if `psum[j] - psum[i] == 0`. To make sense of this, however much `0`s or `1`s `psum[j]` has, if `psum[i]` has the same amount, their difference will result in `0`, indicating that the quantity of `0` and `1` matches.

We can then loop over the array in order while maintainig a prefix sum, and a HashMap recording the first index of each prefix sum value prior to the current index. Thus, we can effectively find the longest subarray at each point.

class Solution {
public:
    int findMaxLength(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_map<int, int> map;
        int psum = 0;
        int ans = 0;
        map[psum] = -1;
        for(int i = 0; i< nums.size(); i++){
            psum += (nums[i] == 0) ? -1 : 1;
            if(map.contains(psum))
                ans = max(i - map[psum] , ans);
            else
                map[psum] = i;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
